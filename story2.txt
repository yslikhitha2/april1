Lena had always been fascinated by the abandoned lighthouse at the edge of town. Stories of its mysterious glow on moonless nights intrigued her, but no one dared to go near. One evening, driven by curiosity, she sneaked inside. Dust covered the spiral staircase, and the air smelled of salt and old wood. As she reached the top, she discovered an ancient lantern flickering on its own, casting eerie patterns on the walls. Suddenly, a gust of wind slammed the door shut behind her, and a soft whisper echoed in the empty chamber.
Heart pounding, Lena turned to see a faded journal resting beside the lantern. She flipped through its brittle pages and found entries from a lighthouse keeper who vanished a century ago. His last words warned of a spirit bound to the light, waiting for someone to set it free. Just then, the lanternâ€™s glow intensified, and a shadowy figure emerged. Instead of fear, Lena felt a strange calm.
